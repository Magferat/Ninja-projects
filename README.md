#Project Name & Pihch
Shinobi Battale

This application used to load data form a JSON API . It is built with React JS, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

#Project Status

This project is currently in development. 

#Components :

Here I used some components to organize all codes . 
1 . First Of All I Made two Components for Header part and for Body Part. I named them as "Header" and "Team" .
2 . In 'Team' components I call 2 more components. They are "Ninja" and "Core Team" . I fetched JSON data in "Team" components, then pass data as props to "Ninja" . In "NInja" components I display data dynamically . 
3 . So "Team" Components is the parent of "Ninja" "CoreTeam" Componets

#Reflection :

*It is an experimental project . I revised my React, Js, HTML, CSS skill by building this. 

*The plot of this Project was taken 
from famous fictional anime "Naruto Shippuden" . 

* Here  user can form their own team , make an special force with their selected Ninjas and prepare a battle . Basic Information About all Ninjas are given here in Grid Card.I made an JSON file(tools.JSON) for this.
